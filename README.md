             TIMELINE
  
Initial stage - The project was built from scratch at the venue, we had submitted the idea in advance and had a vague plan on how to execute it. The plan was solidified at the venue, where its execution began.
 
Current Stage - Backend and design has been successfully completed. Due to shortage of time we couldn't implement the frontend completely.
 
We implemented the backend using MERN stack and the design was finalised using Figma. We were implementing frontend of our webapp using ReactJS, while we encountered several errors. Currently we are working to solve the errors.
 
The backend is working smoothly, but we couldn't implement the frontend completely.
